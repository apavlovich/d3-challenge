          <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks By State</h3><br>
          <p>This visualization was made with data from the US Census Bureau based on a 2014 American Community Survey (ACS). I used the D3 JavaScript library to create an interactive graph that lets users filter through parameters on both axes. From my analysis, we can consider a few different correlations between health risks by state in the US.</p>

          <p>The most noticable correlation being between smoking and household income, with West Virginia having the highest percentage of smokers at 26.7% and a lower houshold income median of $41,059. The second noticable correlation exists between obesity and household income, with Arkansas having the highest obesity rate at 35.9% and a lower household income of $41,262. There may be a slight correlation between household income and healthcare acquision, with Texas having a relatively lower median household income of $53,035 and 24.9% of citizens lacking healthcare.</p>

          <p>Overall it appeared that household income was the best measure of correlation between healthcare acquision, smoking rates, and obesity levels across all states. However, since this dataset is from 2014, a current dataset would be required to make a more accurate, up-to-date conclusion.</p>
