          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2><br>
          <p>From the visualizations it can be deduced that a lower median household income is correlated with higher rates of smoking and higher rates of obesity, though obesity rates are high at every income level. Median household income is more loosely correlated with lacking healthcare. Outliers such as Texas, which has the highest rate of people lacking healthcare, are likely due to local policy. We can also see that in states where the median age is higher, more people have access to healthcare. This is likely because of Medicare becoming available to people after the age of 65. </p>

          <p>The data also shows a correlation between median age and higher smoking rates. This is likely because of lower smoking rates in each younger generation. </p>

          <p>We see little to no correlation between age and obesity indicating that obesity is an epidemic that transcends age. We do however see a correlation between obesity and poverty. This is likely because of the increased cost of eating healthy foods in the U.S.</p>
